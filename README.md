Retail Supermarket - USA;

📊 Project Overview: This project analyzes sales data from a supermarket chain that has multiple stores across the United States. The dataset contains information aon regional and city-level sales, discount strategies, and profit margins.  
The goal is to explore how discounting affects both sales volume and overall profitability;

📁 Dataset: Source: Kaggle / Sample Superstore dataset;

🔧 Tools & Technologies: 
- Python: (Jupyter Notebook)  
- Pandas & NumPy: data manipulation  
- Matplotlib – data visualization  

🔍 What Was Done: 
- Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Analyzed sales and profit by product category and region  
- Investigated the correlation between discounts and sales  
- Identified underperforming cities and high-loss areas  
- Visualized patterns and trends with scatter plots, bar charts, and regression lines  
- Interpreted business insights and made strategic recommendations

🧩 Challenges: 
- Understanding how discounts impact performance: early assumptions (that more discount = more sales) didn’t hold true  
- Visualizing relationships with weak or no correlation (discount vs sales)  

✅ Conclusion: 
- Discounting does **not** lead to higher sales — correlation between `Discount` and `Sales` was approximately **-0.03**  
- Categories like Furniture had high discount rates but low profitability  
- Office Supplies was the most profitable category, generating 564% more profit than Furniture 
- Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois are the least profitable states despite aggressive discounting.
→ Strategic recommendation: reduce unnecessary discounts and focus on high-margin products and regions

🙋 About Me: I'm transitioning into data analysis and using this final project in my course as part of my learning portfolio. This notebook showcases my progress with Python, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models like linear regression and Ridge regression.
